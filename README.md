# mniAM Bot
**Brief describtion** <br/>

mniAM bot is a final project for Microprocessor Applications subject. It is made for mniAM game written by our lecturers. It is a game, in which players are microcontrollers.
They aim to get maximum amount of HP points. HP points can be gained in two ways: by eating transistors and eating other players. In terms of software, 
our task was to write the code, which decides where to move on the game board, based on the positions of rival players and transistors.
Bot has implemented pursuing players via pursuing curve and is seeking food with a depth of 2 (2 closest foods and the best path to them). 
It was made by Michał Bogoń and Krzysztof Bera for STM32 Discovery evaluation board. <br/>
